Purpose of work
------------------

This module is specifically designed for use on the Livingston Theatre Company's website as of the redesign of 2011. The module is created with the follow features:
  * Front and Back End Box Office capabilities
  * Email System

The Box Office system is intended to be a completely independent box office, with the option to handle purchasing and payment locally or redirect the user to a site where they can purchase tickets. All information on ticket purchasers is presented in the Box Office Admin pages so that the appropriate staff can use it as needed.

The Email system is for company management to send emails to members and the public to keep then informed as to company events

Installation & Configuration

To install this module first a working Drupal 7 (http://www.drupal.org) site must be running. Navigate to admin/modules/install and complete

Configuration options are presented in the configuration menu admin/config

Future Plans
------------------

Currently there is a way to collect a name and an email, but this should be expanded to collect a complete set of demographic information on prospective/current members
